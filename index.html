    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>
    So you wanna build something. The next big app that's gonna make you rich (it
    won't) and you keep bugging your coder friends to do it for you for some
    percentage of nothing. If they're good at what they do, they most likely
    already have a job and don't have time for your shenanigans. Plus it's your
    idea, so you should build it.
    </p>

    <p>
    But you need to know how to program in order to do that. "It's not my thing"
    you say in a whiny voice; you're the idea guy, the visionary. Plus, you're bad
    at math and one time you made the mistake of looking at the source code of a
    website which led to the innocuous feeling of having a seizure. Mmm hmm. I've
    said it all before.
    </p>

    <p>
    Well coding isn't hard. And I guarantee you that no developer is going to do a
    better job than you if you're willing to be patient and put some effort into
    the journey; nothing exceptional, just the same amount of effort you applied
    when you were learning how to read. Or a more recent experience -- the same
    amount of effort you used to learn how to drink beer. Well at first it tasted
    like shit, but then you realized the benefits of knowing how to fake it and
    drink it without making a face -- it made you cool, and all of a sudden you
    were a tolerable human being. You may have even gotten laid.
    </p>

    <p>
    Learning how to program is no different than any other learning experience, it
    can be fun, it can be a bitch, but when you understand the benefit of knowing
    how to do it, you'll be willing to put in the effort. I sure hope.

    This book is here to help you get started; introduce you to the world of
    programming, show you where and how to find your answers and most of all, keep
    you motivated. It doesn't take a genius to program and we're not in the
    business of making missiles (or maybe that's why you're here, iono), so we
    should take the subject lightly. To be a good programmer, it takes
    organization, persistence, and creativity. Last time I checked, we were all
    equipped with those qualities to some extent. So congratulations, you're in.

    While this book is a great way to get into the world of programming, it is just
    your gateway drug -- it could get you hooked, but it won't be the one you
    should stop at. While anyone is welcome to enjoy these pages, this book is
    intended for people completely new to computer programming. If you are not new
    and you're looking for a more specialized resource, I suggest you keep looking.
    One place you can find suggestions for further steps is this books resources
    list which can be found more towards the end of the book. Go fetch.
