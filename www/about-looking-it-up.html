<p>One thing I've realized since becoming a professional software engineer (sheesh, sounds serious), is that no one has enough brain capacity to know <em>everything</em> about the computer and how it works. Sure we all want to be know-it-alls and have the answer to everything ready in our heads, but that's never going to happen. I don't think there's a single programmer who knows how everything in the computer works. And that's quite a relief. As someone who began learning how to program relatively late, I often had the feeling that I'm never going to catch up with my co-workers who were much more seasoned than me.</p>
<p>The overwhelming amount of information I felt I had to know to be a semi-good programmer made me almost quit too many times. But really that process of learning is never ending. The sooner I realized that I'm never going to know all of it, the pressure to learn became a lot less intimidating. And this brings me back to abstraction. I would love to know the physical process involved in sending a request to a server, but it is a complete distraction from what I'm trying to do right now, which is to get weather data to the user (before the seasons change). All I really need to know in order to do that is how to <em>use</em> the network and not the implementation details of how it <em>works</em>.</p>
<p>Another point I wanted to make before going on this rant was that you should never feel ashamed for looking it up online if you don't know the answer. I could sometimes swear that my job is actually to google stuff. I certainly do it more than I write code. I tend to not waste valuable memory in my very limited brain for things I can find on Stack Overflow (more later) in a matter of minutes. No reason to. &quot;Never memorize what you can look up in a book,&quot; said Einstein according to a Google search for an appropriate quote. So I think this advice is at least worth considering.</p>
<p>But in order to find answers on the web you need to learn how to communicate to Google what you're looking for. If you don't know what a function is, that's cool. But you need to know that it's called a function. Spend some time learning how to search for your answers online and pay close attention to what things are called in the world of programming. It will serve you well.</p>
<p>Back to business.</p>
